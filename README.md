# Info

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JJ/perl-mp3-info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JJ/perl-mp3-info)

This is MP3::Info, for getting info out of and into MP3 files.

This archive can always be obtained from CPAN at
    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/DANIEL/ or http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/MP3/

Please let me know how well it does(n't) work, and any changes you'd 
like to see. 

Thanks to all of the people who have sent me feedback and ideas.

## Install

You can install this module in the usual Perl way, from CPAN. If you
obtained it from GitHub,

	cpanm --installdeps . 
	
And then

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

## Thanks

To Paul Cochrane for support and advice.
